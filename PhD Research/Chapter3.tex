\chapter{The Current FDD Scope w.r.t. Fixed-Wing UAVs}

The most fatal failure on a fixed-wing UAV (which have the traditional "airplane" shape), apart from severe structural damage, is a malfunction of its control surfaces. Indeed, an airplane could perform an emergency landing with malfunctioning undercarriage, with a reduced sensor suite, with a broken propeller or even without an engine. But without properly functioning ailerons and elevators the aircraft is essentially crippled. This is why most research in fw-UAV FDD revolves around detection of faults of control surfaces and their corresponding actuators.
Other research topics include detection of Pitot tube malfunctions and icing scenarios. The latter does not directly apply to consumer-grade UAVs, as the icing phenomenon occurs in high altitudes and low temperatures. The former has indeed applicable results to all fw-UAV airframes.
