Introduction to SensPlaceTool
*****************************

SensPlaceTool is a Matlab-implementation of algorithms for sensor placement 
analysis for fault diagnosis based on structural models.

SensPlaceTool is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation.

Note that this is experimental software that has not been fully tested
and there may be numerous bugs still left in the software.

1 Requirements and installation
*******************************

The code requires a basic Matlab installation. Installation is simple, 
just unpack the package archive. On a system with Gnu tar, it looks 
something like
%> tar -xvzf sensplacetool-200x-xx-xx.tar.gz

the files have the following structure (the date may vary with release)
SensPlaceTool-200x-xx-xx/
  src/
  examples/
  doc/

To get started, copy the src-directory to a directory of your choice
in your file system.  Rename the library to e.g. sensplacetool and add
the directory to Matlabs search path, e.g.  using the addpath command
in Matlab. This is it and now all things are installed. Try the
predefined examples collected in the examples directory.
