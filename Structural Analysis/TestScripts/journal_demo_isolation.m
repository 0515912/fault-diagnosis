%% DELETEME: Analytical Isolation
% O Extract structural isolation matrix (existing code)
% O Extract fault response vectors (max) for all residuals
% - This is a problem, because we do not have all parameters. Should
% probably improvize
% O Set threshold to 10% of maximum R_i and build Analytical Fault
% Signatures
% O Present analytical isolation matrix
