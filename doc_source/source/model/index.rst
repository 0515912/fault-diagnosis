Bipartite structural graph
==========================

The functionality of `fault-diangosis` revolves around structural representation of mathamatical system models. According to this methodology, the system model is abstracted into a qualitative bipartite graph representation where:

 * Every equation is assigned a vertex in the "equations" set
 * Every variable is assigned a vertex in the "variables" set
 * A variable which participates in an equation is connected to it with an edge

Traditionally, no other information is encoded into the structural graph. However, more modern approaches require a bit more information to produce valid and causal results. For that reason:

 * :ref:`sec-graph-variables` vertices are embelished with information on whether they are known, measured, inputs, outputs or residual generators.
 * :ref:`Edges <sec-graph-edges>` are embelished with information on their calculation cost and whether they represent a differentiation, an integration or a non-solvable variable-equation relation
 * All derivative variables must be declared through explicit differentiation equations

Model input format
==================

Currenlty `fault-diagnosis` only accepts structural model input, instead of mathematical equations. Examples of structural model specificaiton can be found in the ``GraphPool`` folder.

Each line of the model description file represents one equation. The indentifier ``fault`` at the start of the line signifies that the equation is subject to a fault. All subsequent words, space-separated are unique variable names, except for the following identifiers:

 * ``msr`` sets the following variable to a known measurement
 * ``inp`` sets the following variable to a known input
 * ``ni`` restricts this equation to be evaluated for this variable
 * ``int`` signifies the use of that variable in an explicit differentiation as integration, i.e. this is the derivative of the state
 * ``dot`` signifies the use of that variable in an explicit differentiation is differentiaton, i.e. this is the original state

Below is a short model description. ``g007`` is the name of the model. The separation of equations to the ``con``, ``der`` and ``msr`` cells is only visual and serves better readability purposes.
